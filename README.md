# physengv2

This is a little physics engine im writing to recreate some of those videos where a small ball bounces around in a circle
and plays musical notes upon collision.

It uses SDL3 which can be found at https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.4.

it also requires mingw32 to compile properly.

it already has the SDL3.dll files however the include and lib files from SDL3 are needed if you want to compile natively.
