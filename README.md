# physengv2

This is a little physics engine im writing to recreate some of those videos where a small ball bounces around in a circle
and plays musical notes upon collision.

It uses SDL3 which can be found at https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.4.

it also requires mingw32 to compile properly.

it already has the SDL3.dll files however the include and lib files from SDL3 are needed if you want to compile natively.

If you were ever looking to use this absolute slop of a project you should know that there is an assets folder where the notes for the sounds are called from, I'll give a better explanation sometime in the future of my process with breaking apart midis and adding them to the project.
